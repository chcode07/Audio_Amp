# Audio_Amp
This is a small audio amplifier built only using jelly bean parts i.e.., 2N2222, BC547B as NPN's and 2N4401, BC5557 as PNP's

This serves as a wonderful simple project for learning about amplifiers built out of BJT's.
Though taday's audio amplifiers use high power differentail amplifier that provide great performance and noise benefits projects like this help in building the fundamentals.
So feel free to go through the schematic and the report for more details, also help yourselves and simulate the asc file I have included.
